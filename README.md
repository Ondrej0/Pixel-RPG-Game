# Pixel-RPG-Game

After learning the basics of C# by making previous games. I want to challenge my self with a game I always wanted to make.
My own RPG, unfortunately it is no-where near finished. I have made the first area where I tested out few core game mechanics
I want the game to have.

Game Mechanics-
  -Player movement on X and Y positions
  -Player has a magic wand which projects spells
  -Wand rotates according to the mouse 
  -Enemies attack player
  -Player has a health bar 
  -Enemies are programmed to seek players position, this programming only starts working once player is close enough
  -If player goes out of reach of enemies they lose him
  
 Future improvemnts-
  -Inventory system
  -More weapons
  -Enemies spawn randomly and only in certain areas(and if player is near)
  -More enemy types and behaviors 
  -Enemy death animation
